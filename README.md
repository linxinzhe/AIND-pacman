# [Project : Search in Pacman](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa10/projects/search/search.html)
### Introduction
In this project, your Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. You will build general search algorithms and apply them to Pacman scenarios.

The code for this project consists of several Python files, some of which you will need to read and understand in order to complete the assignment, and some of which you can ignore. You can download all the code and supporting files (including this description) as a [zip archive](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa10/projects/search/search.zip).
